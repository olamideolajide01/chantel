            How to walk with God
          </h2>
          <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
            Walking with God is a personal and spiritual journey that involves
            cultivating a close relationship through prayer, meditation, reading
            scripture, and practicing compassion and kindness towards others.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
            It is a lifelong journey that requires patience, perseverance, and a
            willingness to learn and grow. When walking with God, you must stay
            open to God's leading and trust in His love and guidance as you seek
            to follow Him. The Bible gives various examples of people who walked
            with God and experienced His supernatural presence and power. Two of
            these people are Enoch and Noah. Enoch and Noah had different
            experiences on the walk with God. But one common thing in their
            lives is that they lived a holy life, choosing the path of
            righteousness in a world full of evil and sin, so God chose and set
            them apart. In this article, we will consider the lives of Enoch and
            Noah and how they walked with God. Enoch walked with God.
          </p>

          <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
            Genesis 5:24 says, "And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for
            God took him." The verse indicates that Enoch lived a life of
            faithfulness to God. This significant characteristic implies that
            Enoch had a deep and meaningful relationship with God. The phrase
            "walked with God" can be understood as a metaphor for living in
            close communion with God and obeying His commands. This verse is a
            part of the genealogy of Adam, tracing his descendants from Adam to
            Noah. Enoch was the seventh descendant of Adam and the father of
            Methuselah. It is interesting to note that sin had entered the earth
            because of the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. So, death became a
            part of the human experience. However, Enoch chose to earnestly seek
            God. He lived a righteous life, separating himself constantly from
            the world. His belief in God was steadfast, and God rewarded him by
            preventing him from seeing death. Enoch's life proves that there's a
            reward for righteous living. It is challenging to choose to stand
            against the norm and worldly standards. However, God is watching you
            and keeping records of your good deeds. God might not take you
            physically from the earth like He did with Enoch. But you are
            assured of an everlasting life in heaven after leaving this sinful
            world. All you have to do is believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him
            as your Lord and Savior, and then you'll begin your journey toward
            eternity (John 3:16).

              Noah walked with God.
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Hebrews 11:7 says, "By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things
              not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the
              saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and
              became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith." The
              phrase "walked with God" is found in Genesis 6:9, which describes
              Noah as "a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked
              with God."
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              While Hebrews 11:7 doesn't use the exact phrase "walked with God,"
              it does describe Noah's relationship with God as one of faith,
              obedience, and reverent fear. Noah trusted God's warning of the
              coming flood and obeyed God's command to build an ark to save
              himself, his family, and the animals. Here are some ways Noah
              walked with God:

              Daily communion with God:
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Walking with God isn't something you do when you feel like it. It
              is an intentional dedication to having communion with God daily.
              Noah exemplified this in his relationship with God in that God
              spoke with him directly, giving him instructions on how to build
              the ark and bring in animals. You must be willing to commit to
              prayer and have communion with God. Prayer is one of the ways to
              hear from God and understand the instructions He is giving us
              about situations in our lives. Without prayer, your walk with God
              is incomplete. Therefore, you must learn to pray without ceasing
              (1 Thessalonians 5:16)
            </p>
          </div>

              He was warned of things not yet seen.
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Noah's communion with God gave him access to God's plan. It
              afforded him first-hand information about the destruction of the
              earth by water. Not only that, but Noah also got information about
              how he and his family would survive the flood. When you walk with
              God, He reveals His will and shows you how you will survive the
              impending danger. This was Joseph's experience in Egypt. God used
              him to interpret Pharaoh's dream, thereby getting the warning
              about impending famine beforehand. God also gave him the strategy
              to lessen the impact of the famine on Egypt
            </p>

              Moved with godly fear
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Walking with God is not complete without prompt action on God's
              instruction. The place of obedience cannot be overemphasized in
              one's walk with God. Walking with God implies a close and intimate
              relationship with Him, marked by trust, obedience, and a deep
              reverence for God's holiness and power. In Noah's case, his faith
              in God and willingness to follow God's instructions set him apart
              from the rest of the world. Therefore, Noah walked with God by
              living a life of faith and obedience, demonstrating his deep love
              and reverence for God. He trusted God's promises and acted
              accordingly, even in the face of seemingly impossible
              circumstances. This is an example for us today of how we can also
              walk with God - by trusting in Him, obeying His commands, and
              living a life of faith that is pleasing to Him.

            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Noah prepared for the end by building an ark and admitting his
              family and animals into the ark as God had instructed. It takes
              lots of faith to achieve this, considering there wasn't any sign
              that there would be a downpour from heaven. Still, Noah prepared
              for the end of the world.

            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Noah stood for what was right. He separated himself to God by his
              way of life. The Bible in James 1:22 and 1 John 3:18 emphasizes
              the value of action against words. The Bible encourages that our
              lives should preach Christ to the unsaved. That was Noah's case.
              His walk with God created a clear indication of whose side he was
              on. He became a voice warning people about the flood and the need
              to live righteously. 2 Peter 2:5 calls Noah "a preacher of
              righteousness."
            </p>

              Was heir of righteousness
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              The phrase "Noah was heir of righteousness" likely refers to the
              idea that Noah was regarded as a righteous person and that he
              inherited this righteousness from his forefathers, particularly
              from his great-grandfather Enoch, who was also known for his
              righteousness. In the Bible, Noah is described as "a righteous
              man, blameless among the people of his time" (Genesis 6:9). This
              implies that he lived a morally upright life and followed God's
              commandments faithfully. As a result of his righteousness, God
              chose Noah to build an ark and save himself, his family, and a
              pair of every kind of animal from a great flood that would wipe
              out the rest of humanity.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-text text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Faith</h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Noah's faith was demonstrated in his obedience to God's commands
              to build the ark and gather the animals. Noah trusted God's plan
              and worked tirelessly to complete the ark. When the flood came,
              Noah and his family, along with the animals, were saved in the
              ark, and after the flood receded, they repopulated the earth. The
              story of Noah and the ark is often seen as a testament to the
              power of faith and the rewards of obedience to God.
