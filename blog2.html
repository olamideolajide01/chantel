            The Tactics of the Enemy
          </h2>
          <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
            From the beginning of times, the enemy has looked for ways to
            destroy the most precious and valued creation of God, man. He has
            devised different tactics and schemes to ensure that man falls from
            the glory God has destined for him and makes him lose His
            inheritance in Christ.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
            The Bible makes it clear that the enemy is cunning and subtle in his
            way (Genesis 3:1). That means that he has mastered covering his evil
            intentions, disguising himself as an angel of light, and then
            striking when we have let our guards down.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
            Every believer must know that the enemy is working tirelessly to
            destroy their souls. Acts 13:10 calls him the enemy of all
            righteousness. He is roaming about like a lion, seeking whom to
            devour. Therefore, we must be sober and vigilant (1 Peter 5:8).
          </p>

            <h3 class="text-text text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">
              Personal information (Proverbs 13:3)
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Only God knows the thoughts and the intents of the heart (Hebrews
              4:12). Nothing is hidden from God. In fact, He is the revealer of
              all secrets (Hebrews 4:13, Daniel 2:22).
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              However, the enemy and his cohorts cannot access your mind. They
              do not know your plans or decipher your moves unless you reveal
              them through your speech. That is why you must be careful about
              the personal information you divulge
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              That was what Samson failed to realize when he was dealing with
              Delilah. Samson had an advantage over the enemy as long as his
              secrets were not revealed. He was unconquerable and indomitable.
              However, he was defeated after he revealed personal information
              and the secret behind his power. Be careful who you talk to and
              what you reveal.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-text text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Hair</h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              One thing the enemy uses to attack you, strip you of your glory,
              and hold you captive is getting hold of your hair. This is an
              age-long tactic of the enemy.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              The head is a significant part of the human body. When a king or
              spiritual leader is chosen, anointing oil is poured on their head.
              The head signifies authority and rulership (Leviticus 8:1, 1
              Samuel 16:13, Psalm 23:5). Therefore, the enemy seeks the hair on
              the head to perpetrate evil.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              This was what happened in Samson's case. Samson was born a
              Nazirite. He was to be the deliverer of the Israelites from the
              hands of the Philistines. That was his destiny. To fulfill this
              mission, no razor would touch his hair as that was the source of
              his extraordinary strength. However, Samson revealed this secret
              to an enemy. His hair was cut off, and he became powerless.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              You must be mindful of where you go to cut your hair. If you must
              visit a salon, ensure you collect your hair after the hairdresser
              is done working on you. No loose end.
            </p>

            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Another tactic the enemy uses to steal our glory and virtue is
              through our clothing. They pretend to want to wear your dress to
              an important function, whereas they aim to manipulate your
              destiny.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Remember when Elijah was to be taken by the chariot of fire into
              heaven, Elisha took his mantle that fell. This mantle gave Elisha
              a double portion of Elijah's power, and Elisha began to perform
              miracles (2 Kings 2:1-17).
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              The enemy understands this principle. That is why they always want
              to get your cloth. You must be careful where you spread your
              clothing after washing them. Those that can't get you to give them
              your cloth might want to steal them where you spread them.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Be vigilant always because the enemy is working relentlessly to
              steal your glory. Do not give him a chance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-text text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Food</h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Food is a powerful channel through which the enemy can steal your
              glory and make you lose your authority and power. We see this
              played out in the story of Jacob and Esau, where Esau sold his
              birthright because of bread and pottage (Genesis 25:29-34). Esau
              lost his position as the firstborn and the blessings that come
              with it because he couldn't control his urge for food. The enemy
              understands the role of food in people's life. He knows how well
              most people love food. That is why he uses it as a tool to get
              them to lose their birthright in Christ and God's blessings. Don't
              eat everything you're offered, especially if you do not know where
              such food is coming from. Most foods have been dedicated to idols
              and other gods. An important thing to note is that the enemy uses
              people closest to you to carry out this operation, just like in
              Jacob and Esau's case
            </p>

              Evil association (Genesis 13)
            </h3>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              The Bible warns us against evil associations. These are
              relationships that do you more evil than good. However, you will
              never notice this if you are not sensitive in the spirit. The
              enemy sends his demons, wolves in sheep's clothing, into your
              life. These people are monitoring spirits who work against you and
              send information about your life to their coven to hinder your
              progress in life. Unless you dissociate yourself from this set of
              friends, your life will remain stagnant, and you will not achieve
              the great plans God has for you. This was the case of Abraham and
              Lot in Genesis 13. Lot was Abraham's nephew. He was with Abraham
              when God called him to leave his father's house to a place he
              would show him. However, it was after Lot separated from Abraham
              that God gave Abraham Canaan as an inheritance and told him his
              descendants would be like the dust of the earth. Guard your space
              jealously. Do not be like a house without a door that anyone can
              access. Let people earn your friendship. Have standards people
              must check before they are worthy of being part of your circle.
              One of these standards must be godliness. Only associate with
              godly people who believe in God and do His will
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              Interestingly, the enemy understands time and seasons and knows
              how to position himself to fit into emerging cultures and ways of
              life. His strategies are constantly evolving to fit into new
              trends, meaning he continually seeks new ways and adopts new
              tactics to attack God's children
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              As believers, we must be sensitive in the spirit and know the
              devices of the devil. The Apostle Paul affirms this truth in 2
              Corinthians 2:11, "lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we
              are not ignorant of his devices."
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3 text-sm leading-7">
              But how do we triumph over the enemy if we cannot spot his moves?
              This article will discuss some subtle yet effective strategies the
              enemy uses to attack God's children and sometimes overcome them
